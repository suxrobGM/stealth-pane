## Why Stealth Code?

Need to use AI coding tools during a screen share, interview prep, or recording session? Stealth Code gives you a full terminal that's **completely invisible** to any screen capture software - your secret coding companion that only you can see.

## Features

- **Screen capture protection** - Invisible to screenshots, screen recordings, and screen sharing
- **Always-on-top overlay** - Pin the terminal above other windows with adjustable opacity
- **Multiple AI CLIs** - Switch between Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI from the title bar
- **Screenshot capture** - Capture your screen and inject it into the active CLI for instant AI analysis
- **Multi-capture mode** - Accumulate multiple screenshots (e.g., scrollable content) and send them all at once with overlap-aware prompting
- **No-focus mode** - Keep your browser focused while interacting with Stealth Code — clicks won't steal focus
- **Meeting audio capture** - Record system audio, transcribe locally with Whisper, and send to the CLI
- **Custom system prompts** - Set separate prompts for screenshot and audio captures to tailor AI responses (e.g., "solve in Python", "give direct answers")
- **Configurable hotkeys** - Global hotkeys for all actions, customizable in settings
- **Auto-updates** - Built-in update checker with one-click install
- **Lightweight** - Ships as a single portable executable, no installation needed
